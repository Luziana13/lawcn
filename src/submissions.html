                    <li>Authors may identify their e-mail with the following subject: “Abstract submission: <AUTHOR SURNAME>, <AUTHOR INITIALS> - <INSTITUTION>”. For example: “Abstract submission: McCulloch, W. – Univ. of Chicago”;</li>
                    <li>At least one author must register, pay the registration fee, and present the accepted abstract as poster in the conference (time and place to be defined) in order for the work to be included in the workshop proceedings.
