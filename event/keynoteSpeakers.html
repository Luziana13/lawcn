                                           <p>Dravet syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder which causes a catastrophic form of epilepsy. It is characterized by prolonged febrile and non-febrile seizures within the first year of life, 
                                              which progress to other seizures, and psychomotor delay. In most cases, the mutations associated with the disease are not hereditary (nonsense mutations 
                                              in the SCN1A gene, which codifies for NaV1.1). Accordingly, non selective anticonvulsant sodium channel blockers are known to aggravate seizures and status epilepticus in Dravet patients. 
                                              Taking inspiration on recent success in the development of small molecules capable of selectively inhibiting the NaV1.7 subtype, we currently pursue the identification of highly selective NaV1.2 or NaV1.6 
                                              blockers that do not inhibit NaV1.1, as potential treatments for Dravet syndrome. For that purpose, machine learning models based on random subspace approximations, linear classifiers and ensemble learning, 
                                              have been developed using NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 as targets and NaV1.1 as antitarget. The models have been applied in retrospective virtual screening campaigns, with  very good enrichment metrics, and are currently 
                                              applied complementary with structure-based approximations in the prospective virtual screening for new potential drug candidates against Dravet syndorme.</p>

                                        <p> Abnormally strong synchronization of neuronal activity is a hallmark of several brain disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). 
                                            In PD patients, permanent high-frequency deep brain stimulation suppresses symptoms during stimulus delivery. A qualitatively different, 
                                            theory-based approach uses dedicated patterns of electrical stimuli delivered to brain tissue to cause a desynchronization-induced decoupling 
                                            of oscillatory neurons, intending to move neural networks from attractors with abnormal neural synchrony to more physiological (desynchronized) attractors. 
                                            Corresponding cumulative and long-lasting therapeutic and desynchronizing effects were demonstrated in animal and clinical studies. </p>
                                        <p>By replacing invasively delivered electrical bursts with non-invasively administered vibratory bursts, we have developed a non-invasive approach: 
                                            Vibrotactile Coordinated Reset (vCR) stimulation delivered to the fingertips was designed to treat PD patients by inducing long-lasting desynchronization. 
                                            In a feasibility study, six PD patients were treated with vCR stimulation delivered for four hours per day for three months. Patients’ conditions were evaluated 
                                            after medication withdrawal (‘off medication’) by means of standard clinical scores and EEG recordings before and after the 3-month vCR treatment. 
                                            In accordance with vCR-related computational studies, months-long vCR therapy causes a statistically and clinically significant reduction of PD symptoms off medication
                                            together with a significant reduction of high beta (21-30 Hz) power in the sensorimotor cortex. The ultimate goal of this approach is to induce sustained symptom relief by non-invasively 
                                            delivering desynchronizing stimulus patterns only regularly or occasionally. 
                                        </p>

                                        <p>This talk describes our efforts to abstract from the animal visual system the computational principles to recognize
                                           objects in video without using labels and decreasing the computational bandwidth required. We develop a hierarchical,
                                           distributed architecture of dynamical systems that self-organizes and mimics the foveal vision in humans using an empirical 
                                           Bayes criterion with sparseness constraints and dual state estimation. The interpretation of the images is mediated through causes 
                                           that flow top down and change the priors for the bottom up processing. We will present preliminary results of a top down focus of 
                                           attention that is capable of recognizing objects in partial occluded images. </p>

                                           supervised 13 post-doctoral fellows, 28 PhD and 43 MSc students, some of whom currently hold academic research positions 
                                           at universities in Brazil and in the USA. Her research work focuses on the neurotoxic mechanisms of homocysteine and other 
                                           compounds accumulated in inborn errors of metabolism, encompassing multiple experimental approaches ranging from neurochemistry to behavior. 
                                           She also investigates possible neuroprotective agents, such as antioxidants, folic acid, creatine and physical exercise on behavioral and/or 
                                           neurochemical alterations in experimental animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. Professor Wyse has shown that homocysteine, an amino acid 
                                           accumulated in classical homocystinuria and known to be a risk factor for ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases, causes brain and heart damage 
                                           by affecting energy metabolism, Na+,K+-ATPase activity and neural excitotoxicity. She developed a well-accepted experimental model of hyperhomocysteinemia 
                                           that has been employed to perform biochemical and behavioral studies to unveil the neurotoxicity of homocysteine. Her contributions have been cited and acknowledged
                                           by researchers all over the world; experimental findings show correlation with symptoms in patients affected with classical homocystinuria. Her studies also help the 
                                           understanding of lipid and DNA damage present in homocystinuric patients and show potential to improve medical practice. She has recently opened a line to investigate 
                                           the neurobiology of menopause, ranging from biochemistry to behavior in experimental models, with focus on development of alternative treatment to fight brain damage found in menopause. 
                                           She has published more than 360 scientific papers in international peer review journals that have received an expressive number of citations.  Professor Wyse’s contributions to the development
                                           of basic health sciences have been recognized by many awards, including “CAPES- Elsevier Award 2014” and “Pesquisador Gaúcho Award 2018”, from the State Research Foundation (FAPERGS). 
                                           Convinced that access to science and education are pillars to citizenship, she develops a social project for underprivileged children of the public school of Porto Alegre stimulating interest for  science. 
                                           She published a book of poetry “Neuropoesia” (Neuropoetry)</p>
